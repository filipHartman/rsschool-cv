### Summary
I am a programmer working at Epam System. I started my journey as a programmer by learning back-up technologies such as Java and Python. But as a Junior Developer, I went to the project as a Frontent programmer and fell in love with Web technologies. I know that I lack the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and that's why I joined RS School. I know this will help develop my career as a Front-End or Full-Stack programmer.
